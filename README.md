# IITG OLX

## Instructions : 

* Intall npm in both BackEnd and FrontEnd Folder (This will be install all the dependencies).
    - Use `npm install`

* In the BackEnd Folder, `.env` file change the `MONGO_URL` to your data-base link. 


* Also note that `PORT` is set to `5000` in `.env` file but it is used for AirPlay in MAC-OS, for resolving this, [follow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69818376/localhost5000-unavailable-in-macos-v12-monterey).


* Start the backend and frontend using `nodemon` package (This reloads the app whenever it detects a change).
    - FrontEnd :   `nodemon start`    
    - BackEnd  :   `nodemon start`
